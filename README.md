Remove words in the list that contains bad letters (black block).2. Remove words that does not contain right-place letters (green block).3. Remove words that contains wrong-place letters (yellow block).4. When a good letter (green block and yellow block ) does not in the word, then remove it.5. If the letter are both good and bad, then there are duplicate letters in the word. Remove words that doesn't match up the number of duplicate letters.6. Choose the most possible word based on letter frequencies, and guess for the next round.The above algorithm is executing in loop until it reaches the final answer.## FutureThe target word is stored in the google spreadsheet, which may cause problems when the game is conducted in two or more chat rooms. I need to find a better way to solve it.
